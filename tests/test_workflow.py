"""Integration test for FastAPI-Dramatiq workflow using TestClient with transactional DB.

This test uses FastAPI's TestClient with transactional database fixtures to ensure
that database changes are rolled back after each test. It follows the same workflow
as the previous test but uses the TestClient for more efficient and reliable testing.

The overall flow:
1. Assert the health endpoint returns HTTP 200.
2. Record the initial ``/users/count`` value.
3. Trigger the ``/process_users`` workflow and capture the job id.
4. Poll ``/jobs/{job_id}/status`` until the job is *completed* or *failed* or a
   timeout is reached.
5. Assert the job completed successfully.
6. Assert the final ``/users/count`` value increased compared to the initial
   value.
